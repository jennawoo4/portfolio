<p>I live in the San Francisco Bay Area with my parents and younger sister. I'm going to be a senior at Mills High School next year.
  I like to ski, swim, bake frozen foods, and take pictures. I hope to learn a lot from the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program!</p> <br>
<p style="color:purple;">I like watching movies, talking to friends, and petting dogs.</p>
<p style="color:red;">I don't like homework, moving, or people.</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;">Fun Fact: I am from Seoul, South Korea.</p>
