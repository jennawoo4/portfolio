  <p style="font-size: 20px;">Hi, I'm Jenna and I live in the San Francisco Bay Area with my parents and younger sister. I'm going to be a senior at Mills High School next year.
  I like to ski, swim, bake frozen foods, and take pictures. I enjoy getting boba and tacos. I hope to learn a lot from the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program!</p> <br>
  
  <p style="color:purple;">I like watching movies, talking to friends, peaches, flowers, and petting dogs.</p>
  <p style="color:red;">I don't like homework, tests, physical exercise, or places with too many people.</p>
  <p style="font-size:15px;">Fun Fact: I am from Seoul, South Korea and moved to America when I was 5 years old.</p>

  <p>This is a screenshot from my Side Scroller game, which is called Entity Escape. You move the character using up and down arrows and try to get the candy while avoiding the ghosts.</p>

  <p style="font-size: 30px;">Some of the similarities between Python and Scratch is that they use similar functions. For example, Scratch and Python both have a function to
    increase a certain variable value by a certain number. They can both carry out similar tasks, although they are in different forms. Scratch and
    Python are different in that Scratch uses preprogrammed blocks that you can click together to execute a code, while in Python you have to
    type the code yourself. You also use Scratch on the Scratch website, but you can use Python on the Command Prompt on your laptop.
