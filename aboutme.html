  <p>Hi, I'm Jenna and I live in the San Francisco Bay Area with my parents and younger sister. I'm going to be a senior at Mills High School next year.
  I like to ski, swim, bake frozen foods, and take pictures. I enjoy getting boba and tacos. I hope to learn a lot from the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program!</p> <br>
  <p style="color:purple;">I like watching movies, talking to friends, flowers, and petting dogs.</p>
  <p style="color:red;">I don't like homework, tests, physical exercise, or places with too many people.</p>
  <p style="font-size:15px;">Fun Fact: I am from Seoul, South Korea and moved to America when I was 5 years old.</p>

  <p>This is a screenshot from my Side Scroller game, which is called Entity Escape. You move the character using up and down arrows and try to get the candy while avoiding the ghosts.</p>
